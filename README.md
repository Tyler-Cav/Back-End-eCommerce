  ## Installation
  1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
  2. You must have node installed to properly execute this file with the necessary packages.
  3. Open the root directory in any text editor of your choosing.
  4. In your CLI at the root of this directory, use `npm i` to download the packages. Which include... <br>
    <ul>"dotenv" |||
    "express" |||
    "mysql2" |||
    "sequelize"
    </ul>
  5. Create a `.env` file by removing the '.example' portion of the `.env.Example` file in the repo. Add the database name you would like to use on your MySQL application. Then enter your username and password.
  6. Sign into your MySQL account within the CLI and in the path of Develop/db, initilize the schema with `source schema.sql`. 
  7. You will then be able to seed your data.
  8. Once data has been seeded you will want to run the command `npm run start`. Or if you would like to also install the nodemon dependency, use `npm run watch`
